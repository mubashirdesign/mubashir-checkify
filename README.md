To expose your localhost to be accessible via internet. Download ngrok globally.
```
npm install ngrok -g
```

If your on git bash, run 
```
ngrok.cmd http 8080 -host-header="localhost:8080"
```
else

Now go to localhost:4040 which will be the ngrok interface where you can get the URLs that will allow anyone to access your project.
